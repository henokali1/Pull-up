      <div class="step">
        <h2>1. Chest pulls</h2>
        <p>
          The first step is chest pulls.<br />
          You can do these laying on your front with a broomstick, a towel, an
          elastic band or with a resistance band and broomstick, like you would
          do a cable pull down.<br />
          The goal is to do 15 reps 3 times. If you got this, step to the next
          exercise.
        </p>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>2. Scapula adductions</h2>
        <p>
          The second step is the scapula adductions. You can do this using
          rings, pull-up bar, or if you donâ€™t have any equipment, on the floor
          in rear push up position.<br />
          Do 15 reps 3 times of this exercise with maximal range and control. If
          you got this, move forward!

      <div class="step">
        <h2>3. Scapula depressions</h2>
        <p>
          The third step is the scapula depressions in hanging.<br />
          Here, the goal is to do scapula depressions with your whole
          bodyweight. This exercise is as important as the previous one for
          doing proper pull-ups.<br />
          The goal is 15 reps and 30 seconds hold on the top, 3 times. If you
          got this, step to the next exercise.
        </p>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>4. Scapula pulls</h2>
        <p>
          The fourth step is the scapula pulls. This exercise combines the
          previous two; after depressing your scapulas, you should bring them
          closer together by pushing out your chest, as you can see in the
          video. However, an easier, smaller range of motion execution is also
          perfectly adequate for achieving pull-ups. The goal is 10 reps 3
          times, and you can move forward.

      <div class="step">
        <h2>5. 45 inverted rows</h2>
        <p>
          The 5th step is the 45 degree inverted rows. After mastering the
          scapular movements, you can now strengthen the pulling motion. The
          inverted row plays a key role in this, and it's important to properly
          master all the upcoming progressions. The goal is 15 reps 3 times. If
          you got this, you can move on.

      <div class="step">
        <h2>6. Inverted rows with bent knees</h2>
        <p>
          The sixth step is the inverted rows with bent knees. Here, we increase
          the body's angle, but reduce its length due to the bent knees, in
          order to ensure gradual progression. The goal is 15 reps 3 times. If
          you got this, step to the next exercise.

      <div class="step">
        <h2>7. Inverted rows</h2>
        <p>
          The 7th step is the inverted rows with straight body, close to the
          ground. The goal is 15 reps 3 times. If you got this, you can move on.
        </p>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>8. Elevated leg inverted rows</h2>
        <p>
          The 8th step is the elevated leg inverted rows. This is the last
          inverted row progression, but once you're able to do this, you'll
          automatically be able to perform a few pull-ups - at least, that's
          been my experience with my students. The goal here is also to achieve
          3 sets of 15 repetitions, but experience shows that with at least 3
          sets of 10 reps, students were able to progress well as they moved
          forward.

      <div class="step">
        <h2>9. Leg assisted pull-ups</h2>
        <p>
          The 9th step is the leg assisted pull-ups. This progression is great
          for practicing the technique, but it's important that if you're
          practicing at such a low intensity, the execution should be really
          perfect. The goal here is also 3 sets of 15 reps.
        </p>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>10. Upper end-point hold and negatives</h2>
        <p>
          The 10th step is holding the upper end-point hold then doing
          negatives. The upper point hold is a very powerful progression. If you
          have strength issues, initially, you can do it with an underhand grip,
          then gradually switch to a neutral grip if possible, and finally
          practice it with an overhand grip. The descent should last at least 5
          seconds. Complete 3 sets of 6 repetitions before moving on!

      <div class="step">
        <h2>11. Pull-up with elastic band</h2>
        <p>
          The 11th step is pull-up with elastic band. This is one of the most
          popular progressions because it provides a good sense of
          accomplishment and perfectly enables the realistic execution of
          pull-ups. The goal here is 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions.

      <div class="step">
        <h2>12. Pull-up</h2>
        <p>
          The twelfth and final step is the goal itself: the pull-up. If you
          have accurately completed the previous steps, then you should be able
          to do a perfect chest to bar pull-up.
